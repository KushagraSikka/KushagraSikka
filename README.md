## üíº Professional Story

My journey in software development began with a fascination for the power of technology to transform ideas into reality. This curiosity led me to pursue a Master of Science in Information Technology at Northern Arizona University, where I honed my skills in web technologies and gained a deep understanding of software development principles.

My experiences have been diverse and impactful. As a **Jr. Full Stack Developer Intern at Progress Solutions Inc.**, I am actively involved in developing full-stack AI-driven applications, integrating LLMs and generative AI capabilities to solve real-world problems. I'm building scalable web applications using cutting-edge technologies like React, Next.js, Python, Node.js, and FastAPI. A core part of my work involves architecting and optimizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines using vector databases like Pinecone, Weaviate, and Supabase. This role has allowed me to contribute to secure and ethical AI deployment practices, ensuring data privacy and compliance with governance policies.

Prior to this, I served as a **Teaching Assistant at Northern Arizona University**, where I mentored over 40 students in web technologies. I designed hands-on exercises and provided personalized support, improving student success rates by 30%. I also played a key role in modernizing the curriculum by introducing React fundamentals and Git/GitHub version control.

My early experience as a **Salesforce Developer Intern at Smart Internz** provided me with a strong foundation in CRM systems and business automation. I developed workflows using Flows and Validation Rules, wrote Apex triggers, and built Lightning Web Components to extend the CRM UI.

My unique perspective combines a strong academic foundation with practical experience in full-stack development and AI. I am passionate about continuous learning and staying at the forefront of technology trends.
